Congressman Kevin Yoder, Proudly Representing the 3rd District of
 Kansas
=========================================================================

*
	Last Week in Congress*
*
	House Votes to Fix Our Broken
 Health Care System*

[image =
 http://yoder.congressnewsletter.net//images/user_images/PassedAHCA.JPG]

On Thursday, the House of
 Representatives took the first step in fulfilling our promise to repeal and replace
 Obamacare.

There are two questions I answer with respect to every
 vote on the House floor: is this the right bill for my district and will
 it make the future of America stronger. The *American Health Care
 Act* [link 1] succeeds on both.

Obamacare’s big government mandates,
 taxes, and spending are destroying our health care system today. The last
 insurance providers are pulling out of Iowa and dozens of counties
 across Tennessee and Virginia – leaving millions on the individual
 market with no options for care – and Kansas could be next.

 

That leaves
 us with a choice between two solutions to repair our broken system.
 We can turn to socialized medicine and a single payer system that puts
 government in control, or we can restore a system of personalized
 medicine where patients and doctors are in control. Rather than giving the
 federal government full control of hospitals, lowering the quality of
 care, and costing our country more than $30 trillion – what single
 payer will do – I voted to choose markets over mandates, innovation over
 regulation, and patients over bureaucrats.

 

The AHCA makes
 necessary and immediate repairs to the devastated system left in Obamacare’s
 wake, and will provide more choice, more competition, lower premiums,
 and greater access to care in the future. It reduces taxes and
 spending, and lowers federal deficits. It restores freedom by repealing the
 failed individual and employer mandates.

 

Let me be clear – no one
 with preexisting conditions can or will be denied affordable coverage
 under the AHCA now or ever. In reality, our bill frees states to
 develop innovative ways to provide them with better coverage than they
 receive now and invests nearly $140 billion to help them succeed in doing
 it.

 

Instead of forcing Americans to buy plans they don’t want or
 can’t afford, regulating insurance providers out of the market
 altogether, or leaving people with no options to choose from, the AHCA makes
 the necessary changes to repair our health care system that’s collapsing
 before our eyes. The bill now heads to the Senate for approval. I
 urge my Senate colleagues to send the AHCA to the President's desk for
 signature so we can fix our broken health care system,

*
	The American Health Care Act*

[image =
 http://yoder.congressnewsletter.net//images/user_images/AHCA_1.JPG]

So what does the
 *American Health Care Act (AHCA)* actually do? Opponents of health care
 reform have been spreading misinformation and using scare tactics to drum
 up opposition to the bill. Throughout the process, I spent a lot of
 time reading and understanding the bill and its amendments that were
 added along the way. Here's what the bill accomplishes by repealing and
 replacing Obamacare and making much-needed fixes to our broken health
 care system: 

 

*Guarantees Coverage for Americans with Preexisting
 Conditions:* The AHCA bans health insurance providers from denying
 coverage or charging a patient with preexisting conditions higher premiums
 as long as they maintain continuous coverage, or sign up for new
 coverage within 63 days of exiting a previous insurance
 plan.

 

*Establishes a Patient and State Stability Fund and Federal Invisible Risk
 Sharing Program:* The AHCA provides states with nearly $140 billion to
 design programs that meet the unique needs of their patient populations,
 help low-income Americans afford health care, and provide a backstop
 safety net for Americans with preexisting conditions. This includes
 $15 billion specifically for mental health care, substance abuse care,
 and maternity and newborn care.

 

*Keeps Age 26 Provision:* We
 recognize that some provisions of Obamacare are positive. The AHCA continues
 to help young adults access health insurance and stabilize the
 marketplace by allowing individuals to stay on their parents’ plan until
 they are 26.

 

*Helps Americans Access Affordable, Quality Health
 Care:* The AHCA establishes a monthly tax credit between $2,000 and $14,000
 a year for low- and middle-income individuals and families who don’t
 receive insurance through work or a government program. Americans can
 use this tax credit to purchase the insurance plans of their
 choice.

 

*Empowers Individuals and Families:* Rather than relying on the
 government under Obamacare, the AHCA empowers Americans' to spend their
 health care dollars the way they want and need by nearly doubling the
 amount of money people can contribute to their Health Savings Accounts
 (HSAs).

 

*Repeals $1 Trillion in Obamacare Taxes:* Under Obamacare,
 job-killing taxes have increased premium costs and limited options
 for patients and health care providers. The AHCA repeals these taxes
 that hit the middle class and the poor the hardest, like taxes on
 prescription drugs, over-the-counter medications, health-insurance premiums,
 and medical devices. 

 

*Restores Freedom by Eliminating the
 Individual and Employer Mandates:* Millions of workers, families, and job
 creators were forced into expensive Obamacare plans they don’t want and
 can't afford. The AHCA does away with these mandates. 

 

*Modernizes
 and Strengthens Medicaid:* The AHCA transitions to a “per capita
 allotment” for Medicaid so states can better serve the poor and Americans
 with disabilities who rely on the program. These reforms represent the
 largest entitlement reform in a generation and put the program on a
 sustainable fiscal path. After all, if the program becomes insolvent it
 won't be able to serve anyone.  

 

*Promotes Work and Individual
 Freedom:* The AHCA incentivizes able-bodied adults to obtain private
 health care through employment so Medicaid can be refocused on helping the
 most vulnerable.

	Chairing My First
 Bipartisan Legislative Branch Subcommittee Hearing*

[image =

Kevin and Ranking Member Ryan holding a hearing
 featuring proponents of making CRS reports public.

It was exciting
 to Chair my first bipartisan *Legislative Branch Subcommittee* Hearing
 with Ranking Member Congressman Tim Ryan (D-OH) on increasing
 transparency in Congress. On Wednesday, a bill was introduced that would
 require all the reports produced by the Congressional Research Service
 (CRS) to be published for the American people to access. Right now, CRS
 reports are only available to Members of Congress and their
 staff.

 

Throughout my career in Congress I've been a proponent of more
 transparency and accountability in government. At last week's hearing, we
 heard from proponents of the idea of making these reports public. I look
 forward to working with Ranking Member Ryan as we continue this debate
 and work with other members of committee to advance the process on
 this legislation.

Click here to watch Kevin's
 remarks on the 2017 omnibus funding bill. [link 5]

Last week, I
 joined my colleagues in the House in passing the *appropriations bill*
 [link 6] to fund the federal government through the end of the 2017 fiscal
 year on September 30th. It is a bipartisan agreement that shows
 Congress is working with the Trump Administration to keep the government
 running smoothly to ensure seniors depending on Medicare and Social
 Security, our veterans depending on VA benefits, and active duty military
 depending on their pay checks are receiving the services they need,
 while also achieving significant conservative gains compared to the last
 eight years. It makes needed investments in medical research –
 including another $2 billion for research at the NIH for a 13% increase over
 the last two years – as well as education, protecting our border, and
 our soldiers.

	Empowering Workers to Better
 Balance Work, Life, and Family*

[image =
 http://yoder.congressnewsletter.net//images/user_images/9_7.PNG]

It's time that we brought the
 American workforce into the 21st century. In today's day and age, working
 families need flexibility, whether that's for single parents in the
 workforce or students who are trying to pursue a college degree while
 working a full time job. That's why the House of Representatives passed
 the* Working Families Flexibility Act [link 8]* last week, to take
 down barriers to workers who need more freedom to balance work and
 personal obligations. This bill gives workers the flexibility to spend time
 with family, attend teacher conferences, and care for aging parents
 by allowing private-sector employers to offer their employees the
 choice of paid time off in lieu of cash wages for overtime hours.

I always enjoy meeting with some of the local community bankers to
 listen to their thoughts and concerns about policies in DC. Last week,
 I met with the *Kansas Community Bankers* to discuss the steps
 Congress has taken to reduce burdensome regulations on the local banks that
 serve the Third District. Thanks for taking the time to meet with
 me.

 with Michelle Taylor and her daughter Elliana Jaymes Henry of Overland Park. 

As
 a strong supporter of early childhood education, I firmly believe in
 the importance of investing in the early years of children's lives.
 Last week, I met with ZERO TO THREE to discuss why Congress should “Think
 Babies” to ensure that babies and toddlers benefit from the early
 connections that are critical to their well-being and development. Thanks
 to Michelle Taylor and her daughter Elliana Jaymes Henry of Overland
 Park for coming to Capitol Hill to help raise awareness to what babies
 and families need to thrive including early childhood education and
 workforce issues.

	Military Makeover for Zeke & Lacy Crozier*

Kevin meeting R. Lee
 Ermey before the Croziers' Military Makeover unveiling.

Last Friday it
 was fun to help R. Lee Ermey, more famously known as “The Gunny,” a
 host for *Lifetime's Military Makeover*, give my friend and local
 veteran Zeke Crozier and his family a home makeover in Overland Park. Many
 local veterans organizations supported this project for the Croziers
 and I was excited to be a part of it. Years ago, Zeke came to my office
 for assistance with dealing with the *Department of Veterans Affairs

	American Health Care Act: Myth vs. Fact*

*MYTH: The American
 Health Care Act will price those with preexisting conditions out of the
 market, making health care unaffordable for them.*

 

*FACT: *Under
 the AHCA, rules that prevent insurance providers from denying coverage
 or charging more expensive rates based on health status remain the law
 of the land.

 

If states can show they have new innovative
 solutions to protect individuals with preexisting conditions in a better way,
 they can waive out of this regulatory framework ONLY for individuals
 who have gone more than two months without purchasing insurance. Sec.
 136(b)(3)(F) [link 13]

 

As long as you have continuous coverage, you
 CANNOT be charged more based on health status in ANY state. Sec.
 2710A(b)(1)(B) [link 14]

 

Even if you have a gap in coverage, insurers
 can only charge you a higher premium for 12 months, then you are
 returned to paying the same premiums as everyone else. Sec. 2710A(b)(3)(A)
 [link 15]

 

On top of the $130 billion investment in risk mitigation
 programs in the bill, the AHCA devotes $8 billion over five years to
 further stabilize the premiums of the small subset of people who would
 be affected. Sec. 132 [link 16]

*Despite critics’ claims, the GOP health bill doesn’t classify
 rape or sexual assault as a preexisting condition*

One of the viral
 claims about the American Health Care Act (AHCA), the new Republican
 bill to replace the Affordable Care Act (a.k.a. Obamacare), was this
 claim that the AHCA “made being rape survivor a pre-existing condition,”
 or that it “classified rape as a pre-existing condition.”

Both media
 coverage and hyperbole among advocates are at fault for creating a
 misleading representation of the House GOP health bill. We wavered
 between Three and Four Pinocchios, but the out-of-control rhetoric and the
 numerous assumptions pushed us to *FOUR PINOCCHIOS*.

**BY
 BRYAN LOWRY**

**KANSAS CITY STAR**

 

U.S. House and Senate
 negotiators on Monday released a more than $1 trillion omnibus budget bill that
 will fund the federal government through the end of September. The
 bill will have to be approved by both chambers of Congress by the end of
 Friday, when a continuing resolution to fund the federal government
 expires.

 

The bipartisan plan would provide $34 billion to the
 National Institutes of Health, a 6.3 percent increase from the previous
 year.

 

U.S. Rep. Kevin Yoder, a Kansas Republican, said the proposed
 increase for this year should be seen as a sign of congressional
 Republicans’ commitment to medical research funding, noting that the
 GOP-controlled Congress also passed a $2 billion increase in the final year of
 the Obama administration.

 

“No matter who’s president of the
 United States, our commitment remains,” Yoder said. “Because we have met
 with the families. We have had heartfelt conversations with constituents
 who are suffering from an incurable disease.”

<h3>
	House Votes to Fix Our Broken Health Care
 System</h3>
<p style="text-align: center;">

<p>
	On Thursday, the House of Representatives took the
 first step in fulfilling our promise to repeal and replace
 Obamacare.</p>
<p>
	There are two questions I answer with respect to every vote
 on the House floor: is this the right bill for my district and will it
 make the future of America stronger. The <a
 href="http://yoder.congressnewsletter.net/mail/util.cfm?mailaction=clickthru&gpiv=2100141914.5469.823&gen=1&mailing_linkid=127282"
 target="_blank"><strong>American Health Care Act</strong></a> succeeds on
 both.</p>
<div>
	Obamacare’s big government mandates, taxes, and spending
 are destroying our health care system today. The last insurance
 providers are pulling out of Iowa and dozens of counties across Tennessee and
 Virginia – leaving millions on the individual market with no options
 for care – and Kansas could be
 next.</div>
<div>
	&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	That leaves us with a choice between two solutions to repair our broken
 system. We can turn to socialized medicine and a single payer system
 that puts government in control, or we can restore a system of
 personalized medicine where patients and doctors are in control. Rather than
 giving the federal government full control of hospitals, lowering the
 quality of care, and costing our country more than $30 trillion – what
 single payer will do – I voted to choose markets over mandates,
 innovation over regulation, and patients over
 bureaucrats.</div>
<div>
	&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	The AHCA makes necessary and immediate repairs to the
 devastated system left in Obamacare’s wake, and will provide more
 choice, more competition, lower premiums, and greater access to care in
 the future. It reduces taxes and spending, and lowers federal deficits.
 It restores freedom by repealing the failed individual and employer
 mandates.</div>
<div>
	&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	Let me be clear – no one
 with preexisting conditions can or will be denied affordable coverage
 under the AHCA now or ever. In reality, our bill frees states to develop
 innovative ways to provide them with better coverage than they receive
 now and invests nearly $140 billion to help them succeed in doing
 it.</div>
<div>
	&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	Instead of forcing Americans to buy
 plans they don’t want or can’t afford, regulating insurance providers
 out of the market altogether, or leaving people with no options to
 choose from, the AHCA makes the necessary changes to repair our health
 care system that’s collapsing before our eyes. The bill now heads to the
 Senate for approval. I urge my Senate colleagues to send the AHCA to
 the President's desk for signature so we can fix our broken health
 care system,</div>

	The American Health
 Care Act</h3>
<p style="text-align: center;">
	<img alt="" height="181"
 src="http://yoder.congressnewsletter.net//images/user_images/AHCA_1.JPG" width="350"></p>
<div>
	So what does the <strong>American Health
 Care Act (AHCA)</strong> actually do? Opponents of health care reform
 have been spreading misinformation and using scare tactics to drum up
 opposition to the bill. Throughout the process, I spent a lot of time
 reading and understanding the bill and its amendments that were added
 along the way. Here's what the bill accomplishes by repealing and
 replacing Obamacare and making much-needed fixes to our broken health care
 system:&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	<strong>Guarantees
 Coverage for Americans with Preexisting Conditions:</strong>&nbsp;The AHCA
 bans health insurance providers from denying coverage or charging a
 patient with preexisting conditions higher premiums as long as they
 maintain continuous coverage, or sign up for new coverage within 63 days of
 exiting a previous insurance
 plan.</div>
<div>
	&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	<strong>Establishes a Patient and State Stability Fund and Federal
 Invisible Risk Sharing Program:</strong>&nbsp;The AHCA provides states
 with nearly $140 billion to design programs that meet the unique needs of
 their patient populations, help low-income Americans afford health
 care, and provide a backstop safety net for Americans with preexisting
 conditions. This includes $15 billion specifically for mental health
 care, substance abuse care, and maternity and newborn
 care.</div>
<div>
	&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	<strong>Keeps Age 26 Provision:</strong>&nbsp;We
 recognize that some provisions of Obamacare are positive. The AHCA
 continues to help young adults access health insurance and stabilize the
 marketplace by allowing individuals to stay on their parents’ plan
 until they are 26.</div>
<div>
	&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	<strong>Helps
 Americans Access Affordable, Quality Health Care:</strong>&nbsp;The AHCA
 establishes a monthly tax credit between $2,000 and $14,000 a year for
 low- and middle-income individuals and families who don’t receive
 insurance through work or a government program. Americans can use this tax
 credit to purchase the insurance plans of their
 choice.</div>
<div>
	&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	<strong>Empowers Individuals and
 Families:</strong>&nbsp;Rather than relying on the government under Obamacare, the AHCA
 empowers Americans' to spend their health care dollars the way they want
 and need by nearly doubling the amount of money people can contribute
 to their Health Savings Accounts
 (HSAs).</div>
<div>
	&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	<strong>Repeals $1 Trillion in Obamacare Taxes:</strong> Under
 Obamacare, job-killing taxes have increased premium costs and limited
 options for patients and health care providers. The AHCA repeals these
 taxes that hit the middle class and the poor the hardest, like taxes on
 prescription drugs, over-the-counter medications, health-insurance
 premiums, and medical
 devices.&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	<strong>Restores Freedom by Eliminating the Individual and Employer
 Mandates:</strong> Millions of workers, families, and job creators were
 forced into expensive Obamacare plans they don’t want and can't afford.
 The AHCA does away with these
 mandates.&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	<strong>Modernizes and Strengthens Medicaid:</strong> The
 AHCA transitions to a “per capita allotment” for Medicaid so states can
 better serve the poor and Americans with disabilities who rely on the
 program. These reforms represent the largest entitlement reform in a
 generation and put the program on a sustainable fiscal path. After all,
 if the program becomes insolvent it won't be able to serve anyone.
 &nbsp;</div>
<div>
	&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	<strong>Promotes Work and
 Individual Freedom:</strong>&nbsp;The AHCA incentivizes able-bodied adults to
 obtain private health care through employment so Medicaid can be
 refocused on helping the most vulnerable.&nbsp;</div>

<div>
	It was exciting to Chair my first bipartisan
 <strong>Legislative Branch Subcommittee</strong> Hearing with Ranking
 Member Congressman Tim Ryan (D-OH) on increasing transparency in
 Congress. On Wednesday, a bill was introduced that would require all the
 reports produced by the Congressional Research Service (CRS) to be
 published for the American people to access. Right now, CRS reports are only
 available to Members of Congress and their
 staff.</div>
<div>
	&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	Throughout my career in Congress I've been a proponent of
 more transparency and accountability in government. At last week's
 hearing, we heard from proponents of the idea of making these reports
 public. I look forward to working with Ranking Member Ryan as we continue
 this debate and work with other members of committee to advance the
 process on this legislation.</div>

 agreement that shows Congress is working with the Trump Administration to keep
 the government running smoothly to ensure seniors depending on
 Medicare and Social Security, our veterans depending on VA benefits, and
 active duty military depending on their pay checks are receiving the
 services they need, while also achieving significant conservative gains
 compared to the last eight years. It makes needed investments in medical
 research – including another $2 billion for research at the NIH for a
 13% increase over the last two years – as well as education,
 protecting our border, and our soldiers.</p>

		On top of
 the $130 billion investment in risk mitigation programs in the bill,
 the AHCA devotes $8 billion over five years to further stabilize the
 premiums of the small subset of people who would be affected. <a

<p>
	<strong>Despite critics’ claims, the GOP health bill
 doesn’t classify rape or sexual assault as a preexisting
 condition</strong></p>
<p>
	One of the viral claims about the American Health Care
 Act (AHCA), the new Republican bill to replace the Affordable Care Act
 (a.k.a. Obamacare), was this claim that the AHCA “made being rape
 survivor a pre-existing condition,” or that it “classified rape as a
 pre-existing condition.”</p>
<p>
	Both media coverage and hyperbole among
 advocates are at fault for creating a misleading representation of the
 House GOP health bill. We wavered between Three and Four Pinocchios,
 but the out-of-control rhetoric and the numerous assumptions pushed us
 to <strong>FOUR PINOCCHIOS</strong>.</p>

	U.S. House and Senate
 negotiators on Monday released a more than $1 trillion omnibus budget bill
 that will fund the federal government through the end of September.
 The bill will have to be approved by both chambers of Congress by the
 end of Friday, when a continuing resolution to fund the federal
 government expires.</div>
<div>
	&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	The bipartisan plan would
 provide $34 billion to the National Institutes of Health, a 6.3
 percent increase from the previous
 year.</div>
<div>
	&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	<div>
		U.S. Rep. Kevin Yoder, a Kansas Republican, said the proposed
 increase for this year should be seen as a sign of congressional
 Republicans’ commitment to medical research funding, noting that the
 GOP-controlled Congress also passed a $2 billion increase in the final year
 of the Obama administration.</div>
	<div>
		&nbsp;</div>
	<div>
		“No
 matter who’s president of the United States, our commitment remains,”
 Yoder said. “Because we have met with the families. We have had
 heartfelt conversations with constituents who are suffering from an incurable
 disease.”</div>
