Bipartisanship is rare in Washington these days, but not entirely gone.
As co-chair of the Congressional Animal Protection Caucus, I work with
both parties to confront animal cruelty and save endangered species. We
could use more cooperation like this on all the issues.

Congress finds bipartisanship on animal protection issues=20
Erin Kelly=20
=20
Congress has found something cute and cuddly to agree on.
=20
Plagued by bitter division and fierce infighting, Republican and
Democratic lawmakers have found rare consensus on legislation to
protect dogs, cats, horses, tigers and bunnies from abuse.
=20
In the first few months of the new 115th Congress, House members and
senators have introduced more than a dozen bipartisan bills on animal
welfare, including a measure to bar people from keeping tigers, lions,
and other big cats as pets and legislation to outlaw the sale of shark
fins in the U.S.
=20
About half of those stand a strong chance of passage this session, said
Wayne Pacelle, president and CEO of  The Humane Society of the United
States.
=20
"I think we're positioned for success," Pacelle said. "You have such a
diverse group of people =97 from conservative Freedom Caucus members to
moderate Republicans to liberal Democrats =97 who have come together on
an issue they know their constituents care about."
=20
Americans' passion for animals is what's driving Congress to act, said
Rep. Vern Buchanan, R-Fla., the new co-chairman of the bipartisan
Congressional Animal Protection Caucus, which has more than 120 members.
=20
"The biggest reason that this issue crosses party lines is that is has
so much public support," said Buchanan, who was named the 2015
"legislator of the year" by the Humane Society. "About a third of my
district is seniors, and most of them have pets that they love. I've
had dogs and cats and horses myself, but I never realized how much
passion there was for animals until I got this job 10 years ago. It
comes up at almost every one of my town halls."
=20
Rep. Earl Blumenauer, D-Ore., co-chairman of the caucus, said Americans
have become increasingly vocal about how much they care about their
pets, wildlife and farm animals.
=20
"Members of Congress are realizing that protecting animals is not just
the right thing to do, it's also developing to become potent
politically," he said.
=20
Blumenauer said that point was underscored last fall in Oklahoma, where
animal protection advocates defeated a "right to farm" ballot
initiative that critics said would have allowed abusive "puppy mill"
operators to shield themselves from laws against animal cruelty.
Residents of the conservative state, which voted overwhelmingly for
Donald Trump in the same election, defeated the initiative by about 20
points.
=20
Animal welfare advocates also helped pass a ballot measure in
Massachusetts last year to ban extreme confinement of farm animals and
an initiative in Oregon to ban the trade in ivory, rhino horns, and
other body parts from wild animals.
=20
Those votes have helped convince members of Congress from both parties
to support animal protection laws at the federal level, Pacelle said.
=20
"Supporting animal protection also allows them to soften their image
with their constituents and show compassion," he said. "Animals help
humanize them."
=20
Among the bills that Congress is considering:
=20
=97 Big Cat Safety Act: Reps. Jeff Denham, R-Calif., Walter Jones,
R-N.C., and Niki Tsongas, D-Mass., teamed up to offer this bill to ban
the possession and breeding of lions, tigers, leopards and other big
cats by private individuals or unqualified exhibitors at roadside zoos.
Thousands of big cats are being kept in people's backyards and
basements or in poorly maintained roadside zoos, creating a serious
safety hazard for the public while threatening the cats' health, the
bill's supporters say.
=20
=97 Pet and Women Safety (PAWS) Act: This bill would provide grants to
domestic violence shelters who allow women fleeing abuse to bring their
pets with them. Supporters say women are often reluctant to leave their
abusers because they fear the men will harm or kill their pets. The
legislation is sponsored by Reps. Katherine Clark, D-Mass., and Ileana
Ros-Lehtinen, R-Fla., and Sens. Gary Peters, D-Mich, and Dean Heller,
R-Nev.
=20
=97 Prevent All Soring Tactics (PAST) Act: This legislation by Reps. Ted
Yoho, R-Fla., and Kurt Schrader, D-Ore., would outlaw "soring" =97 the
intentional infliction of pain on the legs and hooves of Tennessee
walking horses to create an exaggerated gait prized in competitions.
There also is separate legislation to stop the drugging of race horses.
=20
=97 Dog and Cat Meat Prohibition Act:  This bill bans the slaughter and
trade of dogs and cats for human consumption. Although consumption is
low in the United States, it does exist and is legal in many states.
The legislation, sponsored by Buchanan and Rep. Alcee Hastings, D-Fla.,
would ban the practice nationwide.
=20
=97 Shark Fin Trade Elimination Act: The bill by Sens. Shelley Moore
Capito, R-W.Va., and Cory Booker, D-N.J., would ban the sale of shark
fins in the U.S. Shark fins are sought by fishermen to fill the demand
for shark fin soup. The fishers cut off the shark's fins and then throw
the animal back into the sea to drown, starve or bleed to death.
=20
=97 Humane Cosmetics Act: This bill by Rep. Martha McSally, R-Ariz.,
which has wide bipartisan support, would ban the testing of cosmetics
on rabbits, guinea pigs, mice and other animals.
=20
=97 Prevent Animal Cruelty and Torture Act: This sweeping legislation
would create the first nationwide animal cruelty bill, empowering
federal prosecutors  to go after people who abuse animals on federal
highways, at a federal facility, or as part of a business that sells
pets across state lines. It is sponsored by Reps. Lamar Smith, R-Texas,
and Ted Deutch, D-Fla.

<p>Bipartisanship
is
rare
in
Washington
these
days,

not
entirely
gone.
As
co-chair

Animal
Protection
Caucus,
I
work
with
both
parties
to
confront
animal

We

><strong>Congress
finds
bipartisanship
on
animal
protection
issues</strong>
<br>
<em>Erin
Kelly</em>
<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Congress
has
found
something
cute
and
cuddly
to
agree
on.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Plagued
by
bitter
division
and
fierce
infighting,
Republican
and
Democratic
lawmakers
have
found
rare
consensus
on
legislation
to
protect
dogs,
cats,
horses,
tigers
and
bunnies
from
abuse.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
In
the
first
few
months
of
the
new
115th
Congress,
House
members
and
senators
have
introduced
more
than
a
dozen
bipartisan
bills
on
animal
welfare,
including
a
measure
to
bar
people
from
keeping
tigers,
lions,
and
other
big
cats
as
pets
and
legislation
to
outlaw
the
sale
of
shark
fins
in
the
U.S.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
About
half
of
those
stand
a
strong
chance
of
passage
this
session,
said
Wayne
Pacelle,
president
and
CEO
of&nbsp;
The
Humane
Society
of
the
United
States.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
"I
think
we're
positioned
for
success,"
Pacelle
said.
"You
have
such
a
diverse
group
of
people
&#151;
from
conservative
Freedom
Caucus
members
to
moderate
Republicans
to
liberal
Democrats
&#151;
who
have
come
together
on
an
issue
they
know
their
constituents
care
about."<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Americans'
passion
for
animals
is
what's
driving
Congress
to
act,
said
Rep.
Vern
Buchanan,
R-Fla.,
the
new
co-chairman
of
the
bipartisan
Congressional
Animal
Protection
Caucus,
which
has
more
than
120
members.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
"The
biggest
reason
that
this
issue
crosses
party
lines
is
that
is
has
so
much
public
support,"
said
Buchanan,
who
was
named
the
2015
"legislator
of
the
year"
by
the
Humane
Society.
"About
a
third
of
my
district
is
seniors,
and
most
of
them
have
pets
that
they
love.
I've
had
dogs
and
cats
and
horses
myself,
but
I
never
realized
how
much
passion
there
was
for
animals
until
I
got
this
job
10
years
ago.
It
comes
up
at
almost
every
one
of
my
town
halls."<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Rep.
Earl
Blumenauer,
D-Ore.,
co-chairman
of
the
caucus,
said
Americans
have
become
increasingly
vocal
about
how
much
they
care
about
their
pets,
wildlife
and
farm
animals.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
"Members
of
Congress
are
realizing
that
protecting
animals
is
not
just
the
right
thing
to
do,
it's
also
developing
to
become
potent
politically,"
he
said.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Blumenauer
said
that
point
was
underscored
last
fall
in
Oklahoma,
where
animal
protection
advocates
defeated
a
"right
to
farm"
ballot
initiative
that
critics
said
would
have
allowed
abusive
"puppy
mill"
operators
to
shield
themselves
from
laws
against
animal
cruelty.
Residents
of
the
conservative
state,
which
voted
overwhelmingly
for
Donald
Trump
in
the
same
election,
defeated
the
initiative
by
about
20
points.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Animal
welfare
advocates
also
helped
pass
a
ballot
measure
in
Massachusetts
last
year
to
ban
extreme
confinement
of
farm
animals
and
an
initiative
in
Oregon
to
ban
the
trade
in
ivory,
rhino
horns,
and
other
body
parts
from
wild
animals.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Those
votes
have
helped
convince
members
of
Congress
from
both
parties
to
support
animal
protection
laws
at
the
federal
level,
Pacelle
said.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
"Supporting
animal
protection
also
allows
them
to
soften
their
image
with
their
constituents
and
show
compassion,"
he
said.
"Animals
help
humanize
them."<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Among
the
bills
that
Congress
is
considering:<br>
&nbsp;<br>
&#151;
Big
Cat
Safety
Act:
Reps.
Jeff
Denham,
R-Calif.,
Walter
Jones,
R-N.C.,
and
Niki
Tsongas,
D-Mass.,
teamed
up
to
offer
this
bill
to
ban
the
possession
and
breeding
of
lions,
tigers,
leopards
and
other
big
cats
by
private
individuals
or
unqualified
exhibitors
at
roadside
zoos.
Thousands
of
big
cats
are
being
kept
in
people's
backyards
and
basements
or
in
poorly
maintained
roadside
zoos,
creating
a
serious
safety
hazard
for
the
public
while
threatening
the
cats'
health,
the
bill's
supporters
say.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
&#151;
Pet
and
Women
Safety
(PAWS)
Act:
This
bill
would
provide
grants
to
domestic
violence
shelters
who
allow
women
fleeing
abuse
to
bring
their
pets
with
them.
Supporters
say
women
are
often
reluctant
to
leave
their
abusers
because
they
fear
the
men
will
harm
or
kill
their
pets.
The
legislation
is
sponsored
by
Reps.
Katherine
Clark,
D-Mass.,
and
Ileana
Ros-Lehtinen,
R-Fla.,
and
Sens.
Gary
Peters,
D-Mich,
and
Dean
Heller,
R-Nev.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
&#151;
Prevent
All
Soring
Tactics
(PAST)
Act:
This
legislation
by
Reps.
Ted
Yoho,
R-Fla.,
and
Kurt
Schrader,
D-Ore.,
would
outlaw
"soring"
&#151;
the
intentional
infliction
of
pain
on
the
legs
and
hooves
of
Tennessee
walking
horses
to
create
an
exaggerated
gait
prized
in
competitions.
There
also
is
separate
legislation
to
stop
the
drugging
of
race
horses.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
&#151;
Dog
and
Cat
Meat
Prohibition
Act:&nbsp;
This
bill
bans
the
slaughter
and
trade
of
dogs
and
cats
for
human
consumption.
Although
consumption
is
low
in
the
United
States,
it
does
exist
and
is
legal
in
many
states.
The
legislation,
sponsored
by
Buchanan
and
Rep.
Alcee
Hastings,
D-Fla.,
would
ban
the
practice
nationwide.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
&#151;
Shark
Fin
Trade
Elimination
Act:
The
bill
by
Sens.
Shelley
Moore
Capito,
R-W.Va.,
and
Cory
Booker,
D-N.J.,
would
ban
the
sale
of
shark
fins
in
the
U.S.
Shark
fins
are
sought
by
fishermen
to
fill
the
demand
for
shark
fin
soup.
The
fishers
cut
off
the
shark's
fins
and
then
throw
the
animal
back
into
the
sea
to
drown,
starve
or
bleed
to
death.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
&#151;
Humane
Cosmetics
Act:
This
bill
by
Rep.
Martha
McSally,
R-Ariz.,
which
has
wide
bipartisan
support,
would
ban
the
testing
of
cosmetics
on
rabbits,
guinea
pigs,
mice
and
other
animals.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
&#151;
Prevent
Animal
Cruelty
and
Torture
Act:
This
sweeping
legislation
would
create
the
first
nationwide
animal
cruelty
bill,
empowering
federal
prosecutors&nbsp;
to
go
after
people
who
abuse
animals
on
federal
highways,
at
a
federal
facility,
or
as
part
of
a
business
that
sells
pets
across
state
lines.
It
is
sponsored
by
Reps.
Lamar
Smith,
R-Texas,
and
Ted
Deutch,
D-Fla.</p
